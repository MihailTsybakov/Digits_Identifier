Neural Network for identifying handwritten digits

Learn method = stohastic gradient descent (backpropagation) + L2-regularization

Best Reached Accuracy = 0.96 on MNIST test dataset (first 1k digits measured)
Upd: Best Reached Accuracy = 0.978 on MNIST test dataset (first 1k digits measured)

Weights init = normal Gaussian distribution with standard deviation depending on previous layer's size
